## Welcome to [Astro Xenon](https://astro-xenon.netlify.app)

Xenon is an open source Astro theme for bloggers that aims to excel in performance with accessibility in mind. 

It relies on a few other plugins from the community like [astro-imagetools](https://github.com/RafidMuhymin/astro-imagetools#readme) and [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon#readme). 

## ⛺ Setup
1. Clone this project:  
```
git clone https://github.com/djmtype/astro-xenon.git
```
2. Run `npm install` or use your favorite build tool. 
3. Enjoy!

## 📖 Settings / Instructions

### General Site Settings 
For easier access, general site settings can be managed via `src/data/site.json`. 

These settings include: 
- Global site information
- Main navigation links
- Social profile links
- Number of posts displayed on the Home page
- Pagination size on the Blog landing page

### RSS Feed
RSS has been pre-configured based on any markdown file placed within `src/pages/blog`. Be sure to configure your site's feed information in `src/pages/feed.xml.js`. 

**Postscript**: Adjust the `site` property value found in `astro.config.mjs`. 


### Styling 
This theme utilizes <abbr title="Just In Time">JIT</abbr>  [Open-Props](https://open-props.style/) in a big way. 

In addition, [PostCSS Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) is used to accomplish Sass-like things such as custom media queries, css file imports, and nesting.

- Schemes for `light` and `dark` can be found within the `src/styles/schemes` directory
- Extra and aliased props reside in `src/styles/common/_variables.css` 

### Common Astro Practices 

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md(x)` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
