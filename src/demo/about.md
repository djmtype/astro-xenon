Xenon is an opensource dark-first theme for Astro. Its color palette is based around the [Tomorrow theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme). 

Xenon contains a few other plugins from the community like [astro-imagetools](https://github.com/RafidMuhymin/astro-imagetools#readme) and [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon#readme). 

## ðŸ“– Settings / Instructions

### General Info / Menu 
General site info and main navigation items can be managed via `src/data/site.json`

### RSS Feed
RSS has been pre-configured based on any markdown file placed within `src/pages/blog`. Be sure to configure your site's feed information in `src/pages/feed.xml.js`. 

Postscript, adjust the `site` property value found in `astro.config.mjs` 

### Styling 
Sorry, no Tailwinds. No Sass. 

This theme utilizes [PostCSS Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) to accomplish Sass-like things such as custom media queries, css file imports, and nesting.

CSS custom properties (or variables) play a big part. 

- All color properties are located within the `src/styles/schemes` directory
- All other properties reside in `src/styles/common/_variables.css` 

The global gray scale is adaptive, based on the controls below. 

```css
/* Xenon's Default Background */
:root {
--color-primary-h: 205;
--gray-h: var(--color-primary-h);
--gray-s: 5%;
--gray-l: 90%;
--gray-increment: 10%;
}
```

These values can be adjusted separately for both `day` and `night` schemes inside the `src/styles/schemes` directory. 

<Callout type="info"> 
**Question:** What does *adaptive* grayscale even mean?  
**Answer:** Basically, you can tint your grays. *Be cautious about color accessibility.*
</Callout>


### Astro's Instructions 

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
